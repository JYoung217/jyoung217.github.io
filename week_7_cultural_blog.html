                <p class="lead">I honestly cannot find my first blog post about values that are important to me. Starting DBC, I was overconfident and at the same time, overwhelmed. For everyone that wants to get into DBC or if you’re getting ready for Phase 0, be ready to work. Remember that every single thing they have you do is important and if you don’t understand something, be SURE to ask either your peers, instructors, anyone for help. Don’t pretend that you know something you don’t. The result is…well, me. I can’t find my first blog post because it must have gotten lost in the chaos of getting acclimated.</p>

                <p>That being said, last week’s blog talked about stereotype threats; this week talks about how our values play into stereotype threats. Looking at the list provided for us by DBC, I would say that my top three values in my life when I’m the most satisfied are: Accomplishment, Community, and Faith. The times I’ve felt most full and most accomplished were times where I had overcome a seemingly huge obstacle. At my side are the community to whom I belong and my God; faith is a big part of my life.</p>

                <p>When those three values are present in my life, I feel indestructible; I have the support of people who love and care about me, and I have the backing of my God – what else do I need? I think that I would have no problem combating stereotype threat at that time because nothing can get me down. Even if something were to bring me down, I know that I am accepted fully.</p>

                <p>The purpose of this blog post (as dictated by DBC) is to help us realize just how much stereotype threats are going to take their toll on us during the 9 weeks where we’re on site. I think a lot of information is going to be thrown at us and it’s going to wear us down when we get super stuck or if the work seems overwhelming. Not a single person says DBC is easy and it’s going to be natural to feel overwhelmed and get beaten down. Letting stereotype threat get to you is possibly the worst thing you can go through.</p>

                <p>How do we combat this? How will I combat this? I think it’s important to keep the end in mind. DBC’s on site learning is 9 weeks long. While it’s a long time, we have to remember the end goal – we will become world-class beginner developers. We will have accomplished what few others have done before us. We will have the skills for the 21st century and will have advanced our lives several years in a mere two months. When graduation comes and we get those dog tags placed on our heads, we’ll look back and feel invincible. Remember the sense of accomplishment you’ll feel, the community of peers surrounding you, and of course, the support of your higher entity. Have faith. You will get through it.</p>

                <p>This has to be the worst blog post I have ever read. It simply makes no sense. You start off by talking about space or something, then you randomly start babbling about cupcakes, and you end off with random fish names.</p>

                <p>Don't listen to this guy, any blog with the categories 'dinosaurs, spaceships, fried foods, wild animals, alien abductions, business casual, robots, and fireworks' has true potential.</p> -->
