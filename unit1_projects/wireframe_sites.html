			<p>
				The shaving industry has been dominated by two companies, Gillete and Schick. Harrys is a startup created to disturb that domination by offering users a cheaper outlet to purchase razors. They can offer prices this low because they own their a factory and cut out middlemen. </br>

				I feel the biggest visual challenge when I am on this page are the lines and the organization of shave sets, blades and creams, and handles. It gets confusing.

		<h2> <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com">Buzzfeed</a>
			<p>
				This webpage is giving a user every possible type of news that he or she may want as a 20 or 30 something year old. It mixes news with fun quizzes and pop culture, making it a one stop shop for news for young people. Visually, there is simply too much going on. I mentioned this in my reflection in section 8, but Buzzfeed for young adults is similar to candy stores for children in that there are a lot of things going on and with that, one does not know where to even start. I would recommend simplifying the main page down to only a few options for news stories and provide users a link to access more things such as their trending stories page or the whats hot page.

		<h3> <a href="http://www.gmail.com/products">Gmail</a>
			<p>
				This webpage allows users to have an area to organize their life, which includes email, telephone, instant message, to do list, address book, and calendar. It is another example of a one stop shop. When I look at it visually through its wireframe, Gmail looks very simple. I think there can be more put there, perhaps by shrinking down the middle content area and adding sidebars to the right where users could check on their to do list, have a function for the weather, check their calendars, etc.
