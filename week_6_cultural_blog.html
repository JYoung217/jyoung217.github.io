                <hr>
                <p class="lead">Stereotype threat occurs when an individual falls victim to negative stereotypes about their race. This is a serious problem that I’ve seen in my own line of work currently. As an Asian American male teacher in an all low-income African-American school, my students have been told all their lives that they don’t deserve nice things.</p>
                <p>They are told that they don’t deserve to be taught by real, authentic teachers, and that they are extremely far behind their peers. They struggle with reading and when confronted with standardized tests, they find that 90% of the questions are reading-heavy. They get discouraged and feed into the stereotype threat that they have been told their whole lives.</p>
                <p>Personally, I haven’t faced much stereotype threat when it comes to academics, job-hunting, or socioeconomic success, as Asian Americans are stereotyped in a positive way in all of the aforementioned categories. The biggest stereotype threat I face is with physicality. Asians are generally viewed as meek, weak, and physically inferior to all other races. When I go to the gym and see my Asian brethren lifting 5 pound dumbbells and bench pressing the barbell with heavy-duty lifting gloves on, I admit that I am embarrassed for my own race. I do my part to combat this by combining a rigorous workout program, eating plan, and recovery schedule to build myself as large and muscular as possible. While this generally serves me well with the general population, it still falls short with African Americans, who seem to have a natural ability to build larger, faster, and stronger than Asians.</p>
                <p>I teach students with special needs and some of students are very low functioning. One of these students decided one day it was a good idea to try and wrestle me down to the ground. This student is a very large student – probably 6’ 1” and 270 pounds of muscle. I told him to let go of me immediately and he laughed, saying that I was “too little” to do anything. I thought through my options and came to the conclusion that I had to exert physical force to free myself. When I exerted physical force, it was met with superior force on his end and continued taunts of “You’re too little to beat me!” Despite being trained in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and understanding that size doesn’t mean that much when fighting, I fell victim to stereotype threat and believed that I was physically inferior. I kind of went limp at that moment.</p>
                <p>After that encounter, I realize that I have to be careful with what I say, because while he was trying to joke around with me, it made me truly feel inferior. I remember going home that day and wanting to quit out of pure shame of “losing” that fight. I’ll be sure to watch what I say and stand up for myself when stereotypes of Asian Americans, and especially Asian American males are brought up. </p>

                <p>This has to be the worst blog post I have ever read. It simply makes no sense. You start off by talking about space or something, then you randomly start babbling about cupcakes, and you end off with random fish names.</p>

                <p>Don't listen to this guy, any blog with the categories 'dinosaurs, spaceships, fried foods, wild animals, alien abductions, business casual, robots, and fireworks' has true potential.</p> -->
