                <p class="lead">I am the king of academic BS. I got through high school and Northwestern University by going to class for a few weeks, learning the teacher’s teaching style and what they appreciated. I learn how to do the bare minimum to get an A in any class. I learn how to act, what to say, what extra things to do, and how to play to the teacher’s weaknesses.</p>

                <p>DBC doesn’t work that way. Coding doesn’t work that way.</p>

                <p>In coding, you have to know what you’re doing. In coding, you have to reason through a problem. In coding, there’s multiple ways to get a desired output but only one message that you want your driver code to read: true. BS-ing your way will not be the best for you. Sure, you can cheat. Legions of people before you have gone to Stack Overflow and posted the answers to all of your problems. How do you think I got through the pre work before Phase 0? I cheated, like I always knew how to.</p>

                <p>It hit me like a train a couple days later when I was talking to my peers and they were talking in technical lingo that I couldn’t understand. Despite my lifetime of BS-ing, I wasn’t able to fake this. I learned pretty quickly that by cheating, I would be crushed at job interviews. Cheating in this line of work will inevitably actually catch up to you. You won’t know the concepts behind what you’re coding. You won’t understand the logic. You won’t get hired. You WILL waste $12,200 and 18 weeks of your life. </p>

                <p>I’m a concrete sequential thinker, which means that I think in order. For lack of a better way to describe it, “monkey see, monkey do.” I like to have an end goal, a clear finish line. I like to have an instructor, a task, and be guided to get to the end. DBC doesn’t work like that. They dump a lot of information onto you, give you resources/challenges and say, “Wade through this sea of information and get it done.” Man. That’s rough!</p>

                <p>I spent the first 6 weeks struggling through information. There was a lot. I had no guidance and dreamt in code out of fear of failure.</p>

                <p>I came close to quitting a few times. I remember struggling through a problem for hours, researching dozens of things at the same time, and getting caught in the infamous rabbit hole of programming. Due to my fixed mindset, I felt stuck. I thought to myself, “I will never catch up. There’s nobody guiding me and nobody giving me any sort of instruction. How is anyone supposed to learn all of this?”</p>

                <p>It wasn’t until my second GPS (Guided Pairing Session - a way for DBC to measure your growth) and received my feedback that I learned just how much of a Debbie Downer I was being. I was told: I think you could work on staying cool under the pressure and realizing that your attitude impacts others. DBC is definitely stressful and I totally understand and sympathize with where you are coming from and your concerns -- but your energy was a bit of a downer and was definitely contagious. Remember to stay positive and focused! </p>

                <p>That was a wake up call. I knew that I had a sarcastic demeanor but it was the first time being called out for it. And at that point, the fixed/growth mindset really came into my mind and I understood it for the first time; I may not be able to control how much I’m absorbing, but I can control my emotions toward learning and maybe through a positive outlook, I can absorb a bit more. I am happy to say that whenever I feel overwhelmed, I take a deep breath, think about those who have done it before me, and push through as hard as I can. With this growth mindset, I have a more positive outlook on everything and feel that I’m only limited by my imagination!</p>
