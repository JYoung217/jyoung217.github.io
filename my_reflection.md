Hey everyone,

As part of this week's prep work, we have to email each other some information. When you get to section 7, you'll see what we need to send.

For now, my name is Jonathan and I live in Chicago, IL. My favorite two websites that I use everyday are Gmail and Buzzfeed. A retail website that I particularly like is www.harrys.com - I haven't used their products yet but I did order from them because I thought the website was just so beautiful, haha. My learning style is kinesthetic, followed closely by auditory/visual (has to be done together).

You're also supposed to send your work. Here's a link to all my stuff for this week:

Best of luck! Feel free to reach out!

Jon


2. Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.
