			<p id="description"> During my second year of teaching with Teach for America, I realized that I don't actually want to be a teacher and that there were so many social injustices in the world of education. <br/>I realized I wanted to create something and learn. <br/>I realized I wanted to work for an education startup and in order to work in a startup in today's world, I need to learn how to code. <br/>I'm so excited to be in Dev Bootcamp with you all!</p></body>
