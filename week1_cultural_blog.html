	<p> Release 2: When I think about the happiest times in my life, I think about my high school and college graduation, my finishing my intense TFA training, and I look forward to the graduation from Dev Bootcamp. When I think about all these things, I tend to remember the overwhelming peace of being my own man and that I could take on anything in the future. I was free, and that's why I chose Freedom </p>

	<p>Release 4: The last topic someone asked me my advice for was in the realm of job searching. My friend was asking me if he should accept a job with Teach for America or with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. I gave him an objective view of both organizations and together, we developed a pros and cons list.</p>
