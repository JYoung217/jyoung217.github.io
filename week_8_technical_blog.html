                <p>Two weeks to DBC! This is the last technical blog post that I’ll post for a little bit; I will do my best to keep up my technical blog over the next 9 weeks, but there are no guarantees with DBC’s legendary workload. Today’s post is perhaps the most broad/most interesting blog topic I’ve written about so far: What is the Internet?</p>

                <p>Big topic. Let’s break it down the best we can.</p>

                <p>First off, the Internet is not a cloud. There’s been a lot of talk recently about cloud computing and cloud storage, and all the jobs have been in the cloud development. I repeat, the Internet is NOT a cloud. It’s literally wires, whether it be fiber optics, copper, or cables. It’s literally satellites. It’s literally phone company towers. The Internet is connected via something concrete; it doesn’t appear out of nowhere. </p>

                <p>The Internet is a network of networks that share data with each other. What’s a network?</p>

                <p>Do you remember when you were a kid and you had Gameboy Colors with Pokemon Red/Blue and you wanted to “battle” your friends? You had this cable that cost something like $50 to plug into both your Gameboys so that your Gameboys could talk to one another and you could battle. Those were the days. I always won. Anyway, through that cable and connecting your Gameboys, you created a network. A network is as basic as two computers talking to each other. If you played any Starcraft or Warcraft when you were younger and played with your friends using LAN, you created a network - a Local Area Network. Networks allow computers to pass data (talk) between one another. The Internet is merely a network of networks.</p>

                <p>Just like every single person has an identifiable fingerprint, each computer has a unique IP address. This IP address is where certain data is sent; if you send a picture to Uncle Bob, the photo is broken down into smaller bits of data, called packets. Your IP address is stored as where the data packets are from. If you receive a photo from Uncle Bob, your IP address is stored as where the data packets are being sent to.</p>

                <p>If you and Uncle Bob live across the country from one another, how do your computers talk? Lets start from you. You have a computer connected to the Internet via wireless. Your computer takes wireless signals/data from your router, which takes the internet access from a cable box. That cable box is connected via real lines that run outdoors in your city and that’s sent to a central server (which has its own IP address). Your cable company’s server(s) connect you to an ISP (Internet Service Provider) and these connect you and Uncle Bob’s cable company (and ultimately, Uncle Bob).</p>

                <p>Let’s say that you want to visit a website. Remember how I said every computer/server has its unique IP address? That means any website you visit (which is hosted on a server) has its own unique IP address. You could visit 64.233.191.255 or you could visit Google.com. Which is easier to remember?</p>

                <p>So let’s recap the Internet. Your computer connects to your cable company’s servers, which is an ISP. ISPs talk with one another (i.e., how you connect with Uncle Bob). When you visit a website, you’re really visiting the company’s website server with its unique IP address. The Internet is not a cloud but a network of networks, connected through wires, satellites, or cell phone towers. </p>

                <p>This has to be the worst blog post I have ever read. It simply makes no sense. You start off by talking about space or something, then you randomly start babbling about cupcakes, and you end off with random fish names.</p>

                <p>Don't listen to this guy, any blog with the categories 'dinosaurs, spaceships, fried foods, wild animals, alien abductions, business casual, robots, and fireworks' has true potential.</p> -->
