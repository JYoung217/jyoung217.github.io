                <p class="lead">Many people know the pitfalls of living with friends. Though I knew the dangers, I decided to live with a college friend my first year out of college. I was warned that it could either be the best decision of my life or worst one. It ended up being the latter. </p>
                <p>That year was a painful year for me and I think it was due to the fact that I watched myself losing a friend. We weren’t the closest to begin with, but watching our relationship dwindle from ok friends to roommates to annoyances to silence was like watching a seal get attacked/eaten by a family of orcas (sorry, I watched “Blackfish” a few days ago).</p>
                <p>I believe the thing that really set our roommate trajectory off course was during our second month of living together. He had moved into my apartment and we somehow converted my parents’ newly purchased one-bedroom apartment into a two bedroom. I had lived there for 6 months already when he moved in and I expected my apartment to be a certain way. I went out for spring break on a vacation with my family when I got a message saying “Your apartment was used for a huge party.”</p>
                <p>I had not received any request for permission from my roommate to use my apartment for a party. If I had, I would have told him the strict rules set by my parents. I figured he would talk to me about it. I came back home that weekend to find that the party still had not been cleaned up afterwards. Huge piles of dishes in the sink that had been sitting there for days. All of my beer gone. A smell from the garbage can unfathomable to mankind. I didn’t even know what to say. I just knew I had to get him out of my apartment, and proceeded to clean it all up. In my head, I was imagining all these things I would say to him and what I would do to him when he returned home. He ended up not coming home for several days, much to my frustration; my inner rage built up more and more.</p>
                <p>When he returned home, I tried talking to him about it but he got defensive and gave me passive aggressive answers. After a short while, I realized it was no good for me to waste my breath and we walked away. The next 10 months were silent.</p>
                <p>If I were able to go back in time, I would have done a few things differently. I would have set up strict ground rules at the beginning and would have set up a way to have more open communication; perhaps just set that expectation to have open communication. I would have also asked him to talk via telephone and confront him about the issues I was having with him right away rather than let all my hate build up. Though I truly believe that we were not meant to be roommates, I think our relationship now would be more amiable than it is.</p>
                <p>Lessons learned: be direct, be objective, confront things immediately, and set the expectation to be able to communicate through problems.</p>

                <p>This has to be the worst blog post I have ever read. It simply makes no sense. You start off by talking about space or something, then you randomly start babbling about cupcakes, and you end off with random fish names.</p>

                <p>Don't listen to this guy, any blog with the categories 'dinosaurs, spaceships, fried foods, wild animals, alien abductions, business casual, robots, and fireworks' has true potential.</p> -->
