                <p class="lead">I do not like sharing. Well, let’s clarify that a little bit - I do not like sharing work with people. Growing up as the token Asian kid in all-white suburbia, I was always put into groups of people where I carried most of the weight and in turn, did almost all the work. On top of that, the kids who did nothing or BS-ed their way through got the same grade as I did! When given a choice to work in a group or by myself, I always chose the later; I didn’t like splitting the work because I wanted the grade for myself. No freeloaders. </p>

                <p>So when I heard that DBC was requiring us to pair at least 15-20 times prior to the start of in-person DBC, I was frantic. I didn’t want to be the one to carry the weight and do work for everyone else. I told myself that I was going to do the bare minimum and then walk away. Working in pairs/groups was a waste of time for me; I could do it all myself.</p>

                <p>Wrong answer.</p>

                <p>I quickly realized that learning how to code was not like any sort of learning I’ve ever done before. With the amount of material and amount of material that needed to be covered, I felt overwhelmed very quickly. By the time I got around to my first pairing session, I realized that talking to others was necessary for my development. Before long, I realized that by working through challenges with people, I was able to quickly collect my thoughts and process information in a more time efficient manner. I found myself going down a lot of rabbit holes in the past and by going down rabbit holes, I found myself more and more frustrated. Pairing alleviated this. I think what I found particularly rewarding was finding out that working in a pair is probably the only way that I want to work from now on; it’s more time efficient, more enjoyable, and more educational.</p>

                <p>On the other end, while most of my pairing sessions were enjoyable, I’ve also had some pretty bad experiences. Some pairing sessions were completely one-side where other students were dominating the conversation, not allowing for my ideas to be expressed, and dismissing me when I came up with an incorrect answer. Others were with power hungry individuals who were more interested in putting forth their dominance over trying to learn.</p>

                <p>After all was said and done, we were required to leave/receive feedback from our pairing sessions. Leaving feedback was always difficult, because even though the responses were anonymous, it wasn’t terribly difficult to figure out who had left what feedback due to the fact that your responses are seen in chronological order. In that, I had to leave feedback that had the right balance of being complementary and constructive without giving away who I was. The feedback I received was nerve wracking; did the other people like me? Was I helpful? Was I one of those freeloaders that I hated growing up? Each time I checked my feedback I was terrified. However, I was pleasantly surprised and found my confidence level increased each time I read something positive. The constructive portions were also extremely helpful; I realized that each time I walk into a challenge, I’m a downer. Changing my own outlook on it helps me bring a more positive energy to each session. Overall, I’m glad to have learned how to pair before DBC - it has totally changed my outlook about working with people.</p>

                <p>This has to be the worst blog post I have ever read. It simply makes no sense. You start off by talking about space or something, then you randomly start babbling about cupcakes, and you end off with random fish names.</p>

                <p>Don't listen to this guy, any blog with the categories 'dinosaurs, spaceships, fried foods, wild animals, alien abductions, business casual, robots, and fireworks' has true potential.</p> -->
