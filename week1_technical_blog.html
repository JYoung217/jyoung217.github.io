<h3>
	<p>The three websites I chose as my favorite are: Harrys, Buzzfeed, and Gmail. I chose Harrys because of their innovative idea and their even more beautiful website. It is so simple, so intuitive, so user-friendly, so beautiful, and so linear. They have extremely beautiful high-resolution photos and do away with all the fluff. Personally, I have ordered off their page because their user experience is amazing. The website is beautifully made. From adding items to the cart to the checkout process, everything is relaxed and guided. I believe that Harrys website design should be implemented everywhere; it would make for a much happier consumer experience in America.</p>

	<p>I chose Harrys as an example of a beautiful business website, but I do not visit it on a daily basis because there are only so many razors you can buy! I go on Buzzfeed and Gmail most of the day for work and pleasure. Starting with Gmail, it seems to be a pretty simple design and very clean. There are multiple sidebars and the mail area seems to be written in a table format. Items in the sidebar are bolded when selected, making for easy use. Buzzfeed, on the other hand, is a completely overwhelming website and has way too much going on. The user experience is like a playground or candy store for children; there is so much going on and you are overloaded. I enjoy it because there iss so much you can look at but I honestly prefer more simple things like Harrys.</p>
