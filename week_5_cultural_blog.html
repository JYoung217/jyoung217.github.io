                <p class="lead">Cute. Bunnies.</p>
                <p>It’s been 5 weeks since I started my journey at DevBootcamp. My entire life, I was told that I had to work hard to achieve what I wanted to get out of life. When I was in middle school, my dad warned me that high school wasn’t a joke. I got to high school and it was a joke. When I was about to enter Northwestern, my dad told me that Northwestern would be a challenge beyond anything I’ve experienced before. Northwestern went by without much of a hitch. When I got my job offer with Teach for America, I prepared myself for a difficult two years but in the end, it turned out to be pretty enjoyable.</p>
                <p>DevBootcamp and learning to code from point 0 is nothing like anything I’ve ever done. It’s difficult. It takes time. Your free time (if you are lucky to have any) is spent coding or learning to code so that you don’t fall behind. You will drown. You will dream of code. You will spend nights scared beyond belief that you invested time and money only to be met with failure. You will worry how you will pay your bills. You will worry how you will explain to your loved ones how you’re a failure. It’s all part of the process.</p>
                <p>That being said, I believe that the big issues in tech are a result of one thing and one thing only: it’s inaccessible. I always bring up this comic because I find it both hilarious and true:</p>
                <img src="http://img0.joyreactor.com/pics/post/auto-231485.jpeg">
                <p>A lot of people talk about the lack of women in tech and I think it comes from this issue. For an outsider, regardless of being a man or woman, it’s extremely difficult to learn and extremely difficult to master. You have to learn how to learn again, how to think like a computer, and it’s completely counterintuitive to the way the world works.</p>
                <p>Codecademy? Treehouse? RubyMonk? Sure, they’re okay for people who have SOME idea of what’s going on, but in reality, people who are coming from nothing need to be met where they’re at. When I taught at Harper High School in Chicago’s infamous Englewood neighborhood, I was responsible to teach multiplying polynomials. You learn quickly not to start there. You start with explaining what variables are, and how to multiply. You teach what multiplication actually means and you work your way up to the distributive property. You talk about multiplying monomials, what monomials/binomials are, and scaffold your way up to multiplying polynomials.</p>
                <p>Coding doesn’t do that. It immerses you in difficult-to-understand language, impossible texts to read without a background, and they expect you to survive. No. That’s not how typical people learn. Typical people learn in community, ask questions to instructors, and work in conjunction towards something greater. This “Go to X website and go through all the challenges” or “Just read this book” is a poor way to teach. It’s a poor way to get people acclimated. Start where they’re at. Use real life examples. Simplify concepts and build up. Have a way to TRULY meet people where they’re at instead of forcing them to catch up. Then you will have more people coming in. Women. Minorities. Schoolchildren. Until we do that, we’ll never be able to alleviate the tech bubble.</p>

                <p>This has to be the worst blog post I have ever read. It simply makes no sense. You start off by talking about space or something, then you randomly start babbling about cupcakes, and you end off with random fish names.</p>

                <p>Don't listen to this guy, any blog with the categories 'dinosaurs, spaceships, fried foods, wild animals, alien abductions, business casual, robots, and fireworks' has true potential.</p> -->
